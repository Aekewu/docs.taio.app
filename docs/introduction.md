We believe clipboard is important for mobile text editing. In Taio, you can capture clipboard quickly using shortcuts or widgets.

We don't do everything for you. Instead, we add extensibility to the editor, and you can create your own automate workflows.

We are working on custom rendering templates. For now, Taio supports MathJax, Mermaid, Flowchart, Sequence Diagrams, and Highlightjs.

Taio has a full-fledged automation system, just like the Shortcuts app, but designed for text, and you can use it directly in the editor.

Other than chaining actions, action system supports defining variables, control flows, and even running JavaScript (powered by @JSBoxApp).
