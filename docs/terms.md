## Terms of Service

Thanks for using Taio, your support directly sustains the development. Taio has no venture capital or corporation backing it, we are trying to bring the best experience to users as a really small indie team:

**Pricing**

Taio is still in the early stages of development and we do not charge you anything for this. You are welcome to use the full functionality of Taio and send us any feedbacks and suggestions you may have.

Please note that we do not promise that all features will be free at any stage in the future. The features you are using may require purchase in subsequent versions.

Please don't worry, we do our best to find a balance between **maintaining the cost of development** and **providing the best user experience** so that everyone can enjoy using a high quality product and pay for something that is truly valuable to them.

**Refund**

It is upset to hear that you want to refund, please [contact us](mailto:hi@taio.app) for your complaints first, but we do respect your choice. However, developers are not responsible for refunds, you are encouraged to contact Apple Support Team directly, some information could be found [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084).

**Changes to This Terms of Service**

We may update our Terms of Service from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms of Service on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

**Contact Us**
